# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}
This is a medieval style fighting game, using the commandline. This program uses several 
classes be able to create objects in the game such as fighters, weapons, and moves. The Fighter 
class is used to create the Player and Enemy classes which uses different systems for making
decisions. The Player gets user input, while the Enemy's choice is random. Each Fighter has a 
weapon for each hand, and sometimes has the same weapon for both hands. A Fighter will have a 
basic list of Moves that it can use, which is added to by the weapons that it has. The Game class
is used to create and run the game.

The purpose for writing this software was to learn how to write code in the Java programming language
 in a fun and interesting way.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with the Java extentions pack installed to write this software. The Java extentions pack is
just multiple extentions that you can download at once.

As mentioned, I used the Java programming language, along with the Random and Scanner libraries in that language.

# Future Work

* Attach to an app interface.
* Make it possible to play online
* Add more weapons, and a better balancing system for different weapons
* Add more fighter attributes.
